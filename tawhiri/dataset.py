Open a wind dataset from file by memory-mapping

Datasets downloaded from the NOAA are stored as large binary files that are
memmapped into the predictor process and thereby treated like a huge array.

:class:`Dataset` contains some utility methods to find/list datasets in a
directory, and can open (& create) dataset files.

Note: once opened, the dataset is mmaped as :attr:`Dataset.array`, which by
itself is not particularly useful. The :mod:`tawhiri.download` creates a
:class:`numpy.ndarray from this mapping, and :mod:`tawhiri.interpolate` casts
it (via a memory view) to a pointer in Cython.
